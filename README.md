# VanillaChat

### A vanilla MVC node.js project to explore web development. No frameworks or
### external dependencies besides mime which I used because I didn't want to write
### a mime lookup function myself.


It includes a:

* Web server

* Url Router

* A template engine for server-side rendering.

It utilizes the Event Source and Notification APIs in the frontend.
